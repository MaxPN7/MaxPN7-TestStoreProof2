This section describes the procedure of the data collection module, from the video dowloading to all of the preprocessing steps applied to the audio signals and the video frames.


1/ YouTubers Collection: The last 15 videos uploaded to the channel of 62 different Spanish speaker(29 males and 33 females) from different ethnicities and accents. 

2/ Audio preprocessing: (AAC) format at 44100 Hz and stereo converted to WAV, as well as re-sampled to 16 kHz with 16 bits per sample and converted to mono format. 

3/ Face Detection: Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifier was used(pre-trained on frontal face features). We detect the bounding box coordinates, an image of the cropped face in BGR format,
   the full frame and a 4 seconds length speech frame, which encompasses 2 seconds ahead and behind the given frame. Moreover, we keep an identity (name) for each sample, being able to distinguish between speakers.

4/ Audio overlapping: Whenever it has been possible, that is, whenever there have been detected faces in consecutive frames, it has been applied an overlapping of 2 seconds between speech frames. 

5/ Image preprocessing: All images, before starting working with them, have been normalized and resized to 64x64.

6/ Speech frames preprocessing: Each speech frame has been normalized between [-1, 1] as well. Moreover, it has been applied a pre-emphasis step to increase the amplitude of the higher frequency bands
   while decreasing the amplitude of the lower ones, as higher frequencies are more important for signal disambiguation.

In the end we managed to get this Dataset:
